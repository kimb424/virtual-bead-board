    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Virtual Bead Board ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Virtual Bead Board mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos and Images</strong>: We access your photo library only when you choose to add images to your jewelry inventory items. We do not collect, store, or transmit your photos to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera Access</strong>: We use your device's camera for the AR try-on feature to overlay jewelry designs on your camera feed. No images are captured or stored.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Device Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Type</strong>: Basic device information for app functionality</li>
        <li><strong>App Usage</strong>: Anonymous usage statistics to improve app performance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: All your jewelry designs, inventory items, and app data are stored locally on your device</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Storage</strong>: We do not store your data on external servers or cloud services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <li>To provide customer support when requested</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or transmit your personal information to third parties. All data remains on your device unless you explicitly choose to share it (e.g., saving photos to your photo library).</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information. Since all data is stored locally on your device, your information is protected by your device's built-in security features.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can delete the app at any time to remove all associated data</li>
        <li>You can manage photo library access through your device settings</li>
        <li>You can manage camera access through your device settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
